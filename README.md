# Group Project : Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

## Project description
Twitter has become a popular social network for many users. However, it is also used to relay fake news.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

To train the model, we have access to a dataset of 6,471 tweets that were already classified (0 = fake news, 1 = real news).
